# 🎮 Game Development – First Unity Game

This project was developed as an **assignment for the Game Development course** at  
**İzmir Bakırçay University, Department of Computer Engineering**.

It is my **first game developed using Unity**, created mainly to practice basic game development concepts such as object interaction, matching logic, and simple UI handling.

## 🧠 Project Overview

The game is a **simple 3D matching game** where players drag objects from the game area and place them into a designated placement zone.  
The project was developed in two stages (midterm and final) according to the course requirements.

The focus of this project is **learning and implementation**, rather than creating a polished or commercial-level game.
