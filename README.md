# 🎮 Game Development – First Unity Game

This project was developed as an assignment for the Game Development course at İzmir Bakırçay University, Department of Computer Engineering. It is my first game created using Unity, primarily to practice basic game development concepts such as object interaction, matching logic, and simple UI handling.

## 🧠 Project Overview
The game is a simple 3D matching game where players drag objects from the game area and place them into a designated zone. Developed in two stages (midterm and final) per course requirements, the focus is on learning and implementation rather than a polished commercial product.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Unity** (version 2022.3.50f1 or higher)
- **C#** for scripting
- **Unity 3D Assets & UI** 
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

## 🎯 Gameplay Features
- Drag & drop interaction with 3D objects
- Single-object placement area
- Simple matching mechanics with paired objects
- Basic score system displayed in the UI
